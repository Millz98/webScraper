This code right now is set to a particular website, but you will need to re-configure possibly for a new site. 

This code is also very picky with ports, so if you get a error saying port 4000 is in use, change it back to 3000 or 5000 until it 
runs normally. 


Dependencies you will need to install is 

Axios
cherrio
express 
nodemon
puppeteer
